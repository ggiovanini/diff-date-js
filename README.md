# diff-date-js
A simple Javascript counter to use as you need.

#### How to use:
Copy and insert in your document, usually at the end of the body tag.
```
<script src = "./ diffDate.js"> </ script>
```

It will insert the counter into the 'innerHTML' of the object that contains the 'date-date-diff' dataSets.

#### Example:
```
<h1 date-date-diff = "2019-01-10 12:45:15"> 00:00 </ h1>
```

> If it is a past date it will start the counter for the future. Entering a progressive count. If it is a date in the future it will start a countdown and past the moment it was entered it will go to a progressive count.
